# ⚔️ AlgoArena — Strategy Showdown Simulator

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelsboost/AlgoArena/main/imgs/screenshot.jpeg)

## 🌟 Overview
**AlgoArena** is an experimental **trading battle simulator**.  

Load up simple trading methods—Support/Resistance, Trendline, Breakout, Mean Reversion, Candlestick patterns—and pit them **head-to-head on the same data**. Then throw yourself in the mix and see if your discretionary trading can outperform the bots.  

It’s not about perfect backtests or big data crunching—it’s about fun, learning, and quickly spotting which approaches hold up under pressure.  

> **🛠️ Built Using [kodeWeave](https://michaelsboost.github.io/kodeWeave/)**  
> Lightweight, fast, and designed for accessibility across devices. No build step required.
